Automaton Wolves
K-9 Mark I
Within the Trial Chambers, you have found a slightly faded but still legible blueprint. It seems to contain instructions on how to construct a synthetic creature akin to the common wolf!<br>
This construct is loyal to the person that deploys it.<np>
Being powered by a thermoelectric generator, it should never run out of energy to move itself.<br>
The metallic chassis affords it more durability and attack damage than its organic counterparts.<br>
The circuitry that serves to control it, emulates the basic behaviors of a trained wolf: sitting, following, and attacking enemies alongside its owner.<np>
Much like a normal wolf, Automaton Wolves can also be equipped with armor, and can have their collar dyed.<br>
They can not be healed with food, but can be repaired by using a hammer on them while holding any metal plate in your other hand.
