Tank
Full to the brim!
The Tank is a multiblock that provides space for large amounts of fluid.<br>
It will store up to 512 buckets of any fluid, which can be piped in via the top or bottom port.<np>
The structure can be constructed out of any sheetmetal, it is not limited to using iron.<br>
Fluids can only be extracted from the bottom center block.<br>
Applying a redstone signal to the bottom center block will make the tank output automatically, a comparator placed there will emit a redstone signal proportional to how full the tank is.<np>
Attaching the comparator to one of the top 4 layers results in a signal proportional to the height of the comparator.<br>
For example, a comparator attached to the second layer of a tank would not emit any signal until the tank is 1/4 full and have a signal strength of 15 if the tank is half full or more.
